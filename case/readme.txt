Housing for an SD-Card version of old the Popular Atari-1050 Floppy Drive.

It consists of 4 Pieces and can be assembled without any screws.
The housing was modelled with blender, exported to STL files and sliced with cura.

The generated gcode is optimized for the anycubic i3-mega printer.

Layerheight is 0.2, first layer was 0.15 anyway because i wanted to avoid too much elephantfoot, otherwise the important designparts may be lost.
